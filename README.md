# AQI Vision: Real-time Air Quality Intelligence Dashboard

AQI Vision is a comprehensive project for analyzing, visualizing, and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI). It uses machine learning to predict AQI based on various pollutant levels and meteorological parameters, and presents the information through an interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares AQI data for model training (handled in `project AQI.ipynb`).
* **Machine Learning Model:** Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict AQI (achieved R² score of ~0.77). Other models like Linear Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree were also explored.
* **Interactive Dashboard (`aqi5.py`):**
    * **Live Dashboard Tab:**
        * Displays current (simulated) AQI with an animated gauge.
        * Shows individual pollutant levels (SO₂, CO, NO₂, O₃) with visual bars.
        * Includes a (sample) map visualization of AQI in different locations.
        * Presents real-time (sample) monitoring charts for PM2.5, NO2, and O3.
    * **Historical Trends Tab:**
        * Allows users to select a date range to view historical AQI data.
        * Displays pollutant correlation heatmaps.
    * **Predictions Tab:**
        * Allows users to input various parameters (SO₂, CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed).
        * Predicts AQI based on these inputs (currently uses a simulated calculation, but designed to integrate the trained model).
* **Custom Styling:** Features a modern, dark-themed UI with particle animations and custom CSS (`style.css`).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
* **Pickle:** For saving and loading the trained model.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **Plotly Express:** For creating interactive charts and maps.
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For the particle background and custom UI enhancements in Streamlit.

## Project Structure
1) project AQI.ipynb ->       Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing & model training
2) aqi5.py           ->       Streamlit application script
3) style.css         ->       Custom CSS for the Streamlit app
4) rdforest_mode4.pk ->       Trained Random Forest model (generated by the notebook)
5) Final!!.csv       ->       Dataset file (ensure this is present)
